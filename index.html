                pit for soft/hard/inters/full wets
                one stop race
                five stop race
                time for team orders!!
                play in the gravel
                use the wrong tires (silly joke- the driver won't see it coming!)
                retire from the race
                pit stop just for fun
                tell the pit crew they can go home
                let mattia drive
                your driver won -> don't cheer them on
                EAT THE TIRES
